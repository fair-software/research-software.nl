                                    software is an integral part of the scientific output.
                                    for reproducibility, it is important to be able to reference the exact copy of the software, as used in a given study.
                                    note that just pointing to a github repo is insufficient; you need a persistent identifier, and a persistent copy of your software stored for long-ter archiving.
