software is an integral part of the scientific output.
for reproducibility, it is important to be able to reference the exact copy of the software, as used in a given study.
note that just pointing to a github repo is insufficient; you need a persistent identifier, and a persistent copy of your software stored for long-ter archiving.

Some parties that can provide such long term archiving are zenodo, figshare, etc.
